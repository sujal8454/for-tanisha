        Hi babe 🤍<br><br>
        I don’t know what happened today, but I really missed you. When you didn’t reply, it hurt a little — but it’s okay. We’re meeting tomorrow anyway 🌙<br><br>
        I love you so much that I end up missing you all the time. I genuinely want to go on a date with you, but I don’t want to rush things and spoil it. Please try to understand me a little too, baby 🥺✨<br><br>
        I don’t say “I love you” very often — not because I don’t feel it, but because I believe those words lose their meaning if said carelessly.<br><br>
        You once asked me what makes you different from others… honestly, everything. And that’s why I love you 🤍<br><br>
        Being with you that night, eating together, even that drink you ordered 😅 — all of it felt special. You looked really pretty… just like always ✨<br><br>
        <strong>Oye, I love you 🤍</strong><br><br>
        — <strong>Sujal</strong>
      </p>`
